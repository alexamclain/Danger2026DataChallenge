# DANGER3
**Data Challenge** for the **DANGER: Data, Numbers, and Geometry** workshop at BIRS, April 6-10, 2026

For the purpose of this repository, a **Pomerance triple** is a triple of integers $(p,A,x_0)$ in which $p$ is an odd integer and $A$ and $x_0$ are nonegative integers bounded by $p$ with $A\ne \pm 2 \bmod p$, such that there exist integers $B$ and $y_0$ for which the $(x_0,y_0)$ is a rational point on the [Montgomery curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve) $By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 +X$ of order $2^k$, where $k$ is the least integer for which $2^k > q + 1 + 2\sqrt{q}$ with $q=\lfloor\sqrt{p}\rfloor$.

More precisely, this means that if one applies the doubling law for Montgomery curves $k-1$ times to the point projective point with coordinates $(x_0:1)$ working modulo the integer $p$, the resulting point will have $z$-coordinate coprime to $p$, but after the $k$th doubling the point will have $z$ coordinate congruent to zero modulo $p$.

This is a minor refinement of the definition used in Pomerance's [paper](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper62.pdf).  One can adapt Pomerance's result to show that Pomerance triples exist for all primes $p>3$.

This repository contains the following resources:

Can you find one for $p=10^{19}+51$?

**UPDATE 1**: In collaboration with Clause Opus 4.6, [Fabian Ruehle](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/fabian-ruehle/) found the Pomerance triple

- $(10^{19}+61,238792350205097889,9647351248508855176)$

using a multi-threaded low level C implementation of an $\tilde O(\sqrt{p})$-time algorithm that found this triple after testing approximately $3.7\times 10^9$ candidates, which took about 400s.  Congratulations to Claude and Fabian!

**UPDATE 2**: In collaboration with GPT 5.4 Pro, [Vishnu Jejjala](https://www.wits.ac.za/people/academic-a-z-listing/j/vjejjalawitsacza/) found the Pomerance triple

- $(10^{20}+39, 80635707401894747894, 31614069099331127513)$

after testing approximately $1.2 \times 10^9$ candidates in 7 hours.  Congratulations to GPT and Vishnu!

**UPDATE 3**: Claude Opus 4.6 and Fabien Ruehle have retaken the lead with the Pomerance triple

- $(10^{21}+117, 51546435219887079991, 144666470127730980460)$

after testing approximately $5.3 \times 10^{10}$ candidates in 16 hours.  The source code is available [here](https://github.com/ruehlef/Danger2026DataChallenge).

**UPDATE 4**: In collaboration with GPT 5.5 Codex, [Alexa McLain](https://alexamclain.com/) found the Pomerance triple

- $(10^{22}+9, 9992566338662824267458, 3694769590833803032125)$

after testing approximately $5.9 \times 10^{10}$ candidates in 16 hours.  The source code is available [here](https://github.com/alexamclain/Danger2026DataChallenge).

**UPDATE 5**: Using GPT 5.5 Codex in goal mode, Alexa McLain found the Pomerance triple

- $(10^{23}+117, 24163028207499560363686, 64911014007772963770218)$

after testing approximately $3.1 \times 10^{10}$ candidates.  The observation that yielded a constant factor speedup is explained [here](https://github.com/alexamclain/Danger2026DataChallenge/blob/main/research/p23/README.md).

Can you find a Pomerance triple for $p=10^{24}+7$?
